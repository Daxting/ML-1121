# Machine-Learning-Project

The projects for the machine learning class:

## 1. Housing Price Prediction
This project involved building a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. The goal was to develop an accurate and robust model that could assist in real estate valuation and decision-making. The project utilized regression techniques and demonstrated my ability to handle real-world data and extract meaningful insights.

## 2. Spaceship Titanic Survival Prediction
In this project, I created a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on a fictional spaceship, inspired by the Titanic dataset. The objective was to apply classification algorithms to determine the likelihood of survival based on passenger data. This project highlighted my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## 3. Diabetes Prediction
This project focused on developing a machine learning model to predict the onset of diabetes based on medical and lifestyle data. The project emphasized the importance of predictive modeling in healthcare and showcased my ability to work with complex datasets. It was a collaborative effort, demonstrating teamwork in developing and refining the model.
