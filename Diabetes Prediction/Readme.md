**Project Topic : Diabetes Probability Evaluation Website ![](Aspose.Words.f9ba925c-9ea1-43cb-88fb-8704e78e1d9c.001.png)**

1. **Programming languages** 
- Analyze  datasets  with Python's seaborn package. 
- Perform  machine  learning using scikit-learn in Python. 
- Deploy models on a website using Python's flask package. 
- Improve  website  user experience  with  CSS  and JavaScript, aided by ChatGPT.  
2. **Introduction** 

This project developed a machine learning  model  to  predict  diabetes onset based on medical and lifestyle data.  It  features  meticulous  model selection,  testing,  and  fine-tuning, along  with  comprehensive  analysis. Additionally,  the  project  includes  a practical  application  by  deploying these models on a website system. 

3. **Implementation Results**

The backend of the user interface will also store each user's input to be used later for model optimization. 

4. **Reflection** 
- Implement a complete machine learning application. 
- Learn how to collaborate with AI (ChatGPT) effectively.
