# Data Science and Machine Learning Project

This data science and machine learning project excels in hands-on tasks, leveraging Seaborn for insightful visualizations and Scikit-learn for predictive modeling. The adept handling of a substantial dataset, including 236,378 responses from the CDC's BRFSS 2021, demonstrates a keen understanding of data preprocessing and thorough cleaning.

The project stands out for its meticulous selection, testing, and fine-tuning of machine learning models, coupled with a comprehensive comparative analysis. Going beyond analysis, the project practically applies these models in developing a website system.
